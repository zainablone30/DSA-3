*****************Mistakes in Sir Adeel Code of linkedlist*****************************

-Replaced Null with NULL (or nullptr in modern C++).
-Corrected logic in the iAE() function, ensuring node creation happens outside the traversal loop.
-Proper memory handling and null pointer checks in dAS() and dAE().
-Fixed return logic in find() to return NULL if the element is not found.
-Improved insertion and deletion functions to handle edge cases.
